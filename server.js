// ### Instructions

// 1. Your survey should have 10 questions of your choosing. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

// 2. Your `server.js` file should require the basic npm packages we've used in class: `express` and `path`.

// 4. Your `apiRoutes.js` file should contain two routes:

//    * A GET route with the url `/api/friends`. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends.
//    * A POST routes `/api/friends`. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.

// 5. You should save your application's data inside of `app/data/friends.js` as an array of objects. Each of these objects should roughly follow the format below.

// ```json
// {
//   "name":"Ahmed",
//   "photo":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/6/005/064/1bd/3435aa3.jpg",
//   "scores":[
//       5,
//       1,
//       4,
//       4,
//       5,
//       1,
//       2,
//       5,
//       4,
//       1
//     ]
// }
// ```

// 6. Determine the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:

//    * Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`).
//    * With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the `totalDifference`.
//      * Example:
//        * User 1: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
//        * User 2: `[3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
//        * Total Difference: **2 + 1 + 2 =** **_5_**
//    * Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both `5-3` and `3-5` as `2`, and so on.
//    * The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

// 7. Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.
//    * The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.

// ### Hosting on Heroku

// Now that we have a backend to our applications, we use Heroku for hosting. Please note that while **Heroku is free**, it will request credit card information if you have more than 5 applications at a time or are adding a database.

// Please see [Heroku’s Account Verification Information](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification) for more details.

// See the [Supplemental Heroku Deployment Guide](../../03-Supplemental/HerokuGuide.md) for in-detail deployment instructions.

// ### One More Thing

// If you have any questions about this project or the material we have covered, please post them in the community channels in slack so that your fellow developers can help you! If you're still having trouble, you can come to office hours for assistance from your instructor and TAs.
